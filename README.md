# Capstone project
I am researching the most common dog breeds in each of the 5 boroughs in New York. I will be using different types of data to map out the boroughs as well as if income effects the breed of dog that is purchased. 
# DogbreedNYC

# Questions
What are the top three dog breeds in each of the five boroughs?
Does income effect the type of dog that New Yorkers tend to go with?
Which dog breeds are most popular in general New York?
